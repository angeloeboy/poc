                <h2>Reflection </h2>
                <p>The rapid change in the propagation direction of a wave that meets the border between two distinct mediums is known as reflection. An echo is an example of reflection. Reflection occurs when waves bounce back from a surface they cannot pass through. In reflection angle of incidence and angle of reflection are equal. </p>

                <h2>Refraction </h2>
                <p>Refraction describes the bending of a radio wave as it passes through a medium of different density, refract means change the direction of radio propagations of by causing them to travel at different speed and at different along the wave front. An example of refraction is a bending of the sun's rays when the drops hit the floor, the drops change direction or bend and refract the color forming a rainbow.  Light is a blend of all the colors together. </p>

                <h2>Diffraction </h2>
                <p>The change in direction of a wave when it travels by the edge of an object or through an opening. An example of diffraction is on a disc. The rainbow pattern that we see sometimes on the disc is an example because it is the diffraction grating that produces the rainbow gleam of the disc. Light also diffracts but this is much less noticeable than sound because of the short wavelength of light.</p>

                <h2>What is it? </h2>
                <p>A Yagi-Uda antenna is used for communications between two areas over a medium range of three to five miles. It may also be used to link clients to an access point as a bridge antenna. A Yagi-Uda antenna is made up of three main components. The three basic elements are the driven element, which is commonly a half-wave folded dipole, the reflector, and the directors. The Yagi-Uda antenna structure has one driving element and one reflector, directors can be more than one. Because of the use of directors, the Yagi-Uda antenna has a very high gain and a very directional feature. These antennas are extensively used in the field of TV signal receiving due to their excellent reception capabilities. The Yagi-Uda Antenna is also utilized for military and astronomical purposes. Radio astronomy also makes use of antennas. </p>

                <h2>Pulse Amplitude Modulation </h2>
                <p>It is the simplest form of Pulse Modulation. In this type of modulation, each sample is made proportional to the amplitude of the signal at the instant of sampling. The PAM signal follows the amplitude of the original signal, as the signal traces out the path of the whole wave.  </p>
                <p>In this illustration it shows the wave of the PAM wherein the message information is encoded in the amplitude of a series of signal pulses. The PAM is type of modulation which the signal is transmitted in the form of pulses.</p>

                <h2>There are two types of PAM.</h2>
                <p>1. Single Polarity PAM: A fixed DC level is added to the signal so that the signal is always positive. </p>
                <p>2. Double Polarity PAM: Here the pulses are both positive and negative.</p>

                <h2>Pulse Width Modulation</h2>
                <p>Pulse Width Modulation is also known as pulse duration modulation (PDM).The width of the pulse is varied in proportional to the amplitude of the signal. Since the width is changing, the power loss can be reduced when compared to PAM signals. </p>
                <p>In this illustration it shows that the Pulse width modulation(PWM) generates variable-width pulses to represent the amplitude of an analog input signal. The output switching transistor is on more of the time for a high-amplitude signal and off more of the time for a low-amplitude signal.</p>

                <h2>Pulse Position Modulation</h2>
                <p>In this type of modulation, both the amplitude and width of the pulse are kept constant. We vary the position of each pulse with reference to a particular pulse. Here a single pulse is transmitted with the required number of phase shifts. PPM can be obtained from PWM. This is done by getting rid of leading-edge and bodies of PWM pulses.</p>
                <p>In this illustration it shows that Pulse-position modulation(PPM) has M message bits which are encoded by transmitting a single pulse in one of possible required time shifts. This is also repeated every T seconds, such that the transmitted bit rate is bits per second. </p>

                <h2>What is it? </h2>
                <p>Pulse Code Modulation is a technique for converting an analog signal into a digital form so that it can be transmitted via a digital network. PCM is the abbreviation for PCM. </p>

                <p>The analog message signal is sampled first, and then the sample's amplitude is approximated to the nearest set of quantization levels in pulse code modulation. Time and amplitude can now be represented discretely. Thus, a discrete signal is generated. For signal transmission, this discrete signal is transformed to binary form. It's worth noting that with the PCM technique, the signal is sent in a coded format, which must be decoded at the receiver to obtain the original message signal.</p>

                <h2>More details</h2>
                <p>It is the technique used for reworking analog signal into digital signal. PCM has good or sensible signal to noise ration. For transmission, Pulse Code Modulation wants high transmitter bandwidth. PCM technique is split into three elements, initial is that the transmission at the provision end, second regeneration at the transmission path and conjointly the receiving end.</p>

                <p>Overall, in pulse-coded modulation (PCM), the intelligence signal converts the carrier into a series of constant-amplitude pulses spaced in such a manner that the desired intelligence is contained in coded form.</p>
